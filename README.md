## Project Overview

This is a report made to understand the level of food insecurity in Nigeria across 15 states. Although this analysis was not of the entire population in each of these states but the total respondents from each of these 15 states played an instrumental role in understanding the impact of food insecurity in their states. It provides insights into their average monthly expenses, their individual food situation as compared to last year, the number of meals they eat per day and their suggestions on what will make food it easier to access affordable and healthy food in Nigeria.


## Motivation

My motivation stemmed from the increase in cost of foodstuffs and it made me just imagine how others are also coping and to what extent which was what brought about the number of meals eaten per day and more than the empathy and the food prices inflation I wanted to use my skills to explain that and also keep others iformed by bringing awareness by sharing my report online. Initially I thought would it matter as some people are being affected by the cost of food while others are doing pretty well but yet i still believed that bringing more eyes to see can increase the silent struggles. It was a personal project I gathered and I am I did.
